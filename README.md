# Tableau---Customer-Segmentation-visualization-report
Tableau project 
This is a project done in Tableau showing customer segmentation in a UK bank. This is not a real dataset of UK banks but the data shows distribution of customers in this bank accross all the states/provinces (as recognized by tableau) in the UK. 
It also displays the distribution across age groups, sex and job classification. 
Insights generated from this was used to create a storyline which displays segmentation across all the states/provinces.
